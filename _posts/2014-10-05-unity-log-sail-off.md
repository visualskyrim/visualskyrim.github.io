I have been always want to create my own game, but somehow I turn out to be a backend engineer.

Recently, I found [this post](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/20-year-developer-trying-to-learn-unity-fast-and-write-a-game-to-sell.145190/) that really encoraged me. This 20+ years engineer decides to learn Unity every day.

I decide to do the same thing, learning some stuff everyday and share experience and resource as much as possible.

# Some useful stuff

So, the first thing I'm gonna do is finding a huge list of tutorials and walk through quickly. So that I could start to build some thing as fast as possible.

Here I collect some good resouce:

One awssome list of tutorials collected by an user in community:

[How can I start learning Unity fast? ( List Of Tutorials )](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/12321/how-can-i-start-learning-unity-fast-list-of-tutori.html)

But actually, this list is really long, but reading all of them would take a lot of time. If you have enough time, you could use this list. I do think some of them are pretty valuable, but I really prefer the first comment in this question: [Best Place For An Absolute Beginer To Start Learning Unity](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/348857/best-place-for-an-absolute-beginer-to-start-learni.html)

The video lists in this comment is really good. Very simple and still making points. Especicially recommand these two for starters(like me):

- [Essential Modules](http://www.unity3dstudent.com/category/modules/essential-skills/)
- [Beginner Modules](http://www.unity3dstudent.com/category/modules/beginner/)

Actually, the website is very good. I will check some other videos later.

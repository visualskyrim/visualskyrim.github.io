Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm from China and now I'm working in Japan as a software engineer.
Currently, I mainly work at *server side and data analytics*.
So this blog is now basically about the stuff I have learned at work and my private time.

Also, I like traveling very much. All the photos in My blog is taken by myself.

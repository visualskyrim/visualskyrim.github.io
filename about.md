Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm from China and now I'm working in Japan as a software engineer.
Currently, I mainly work at *server side and data analytics*. I love all these techs.
So this blog is now basically about the stuff I have learned at work and my private time that I want to show(off).

Also, I like traveling very much. All the photos in My blog is taken by myself.
I was figuring maybe I should put some thing about my travel here.

I'm learning [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/) right now,
wishing to find a job about game crafting.
There will be more stuff about that in the nearly future :)
